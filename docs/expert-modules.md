## What you get

The Neuralk expert modules automate the entire workflow of a predictive use case end-to-end, including:

- Data preprocessing: Transforming messy tabular data into clean, model-ready inputs, tailored to the target use case.
- Feature engineering: Extracting and refining meaningful features that serve as inputs to the model and can boost predictive performance.
- Use case–specific logic: Applying domain-specific rules and additional preprocessing steps that help boost model performance even further.
- Seamless prediction: Integrating seamlessly NICL into your workflow to generate high-accuracy predictions instantly, without any additional model training.

The end-to-end modules provided are fully optimized for each use case, ensuring every step delivers fast, precise results with minimal engineering overhead.


## Module examples 

### Commerce: Product Categorization module

Product categorization is a key task in Commerce, involving the classification of product catalogs into structured categories, out of high-dimensional tabular data. 

Thanks to the product categorization module integrated into the Neuralk API, the entire categorization workflow is designed and optimized from start to finish, with no data preprocessing, feature engineering, or model building and training required on your side. You can easily start categorizing your product catalog with our example [here](/docs/plot_categorization).

### Any industry: Classification module

Classification is a common task across industries, where the goal is to assign binary or multi-class labels to items, events, or records based on their features. 

The Neuralk classification module handles the entire workflow end-to-end. With this expert module you can quickly deploy classification pipelines and deliver actionable insights to your business teams, without building complex ML infrastructure from scratch.
