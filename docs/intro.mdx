## Neuralk AI Prediction Models

### Tabular Foundation Models 

Tabular Foundation Models (TFMs) are a new generation of frontier AI models capable of making predictions on tabular data for a variety of ML tasks  (classification, regression, time-series) instantly and without any additional model training.

At Neuralk AI we develop proprietary TFMs for industry-grade applications that deliver predictions at a state-of-the-art accuracy (explore our benchmark [here](https://dashboard.neuralk-ai.com/)).

#### NICL (Neuralk In-Context Learning)

NICL is a tabular foundation model developed by Neuralk AI that leverages in-context learning to deliver instant & highly accurate predictions with only a small set of examples provided as context.

NICL performs best on datasets with up to 250 features and 15,000 samples, and can can scale up to 1 million samples and 500 features.

NICL is ideal when you:
- Need strong baseline performance without hyper-parameter tuning.
- Want a unified approach to handle mixed feature types.
- Are exploring new datasets and want fast iteration.
- Prefer interpretability and flexible prompting over black-box optimisation.

## Expert Neuralk AI Modules

The Neuralk API gives you access to Expert AI modules: prebuilt, industry-ready workflows ready to solve complex business use cases out of the box. 

This solution lets data science and ML teams skip building complex pipelines from scratch, minimizing engineering effort and delivering high-precision insights to business teams with minimal delays (see our benchmark [here](https://dashboard.neuralk-ai.com/)).

### End-to-end workflows
These modules are called “expert” because they go beyond the delivery of predictions: they automate the entire workflow of a predictive use case from start to finish, including:

- Data preprocessing: Transforming messy tabular data into clean, model-ready inputs, tailored to the target use case.
- Feature engineering: Extracting and refining meaningful features that serve as inputs to the model and can boost predictive performance.
- Use case–specific logic: Applying domain-specific rules and additional preprocessing steps that help boost model performance even further.
- Seamless prediction: Integrating seamlessly NICL into your workflow to generate high-accuracy predictions instantly, without any additional model training.

The end-to-end modules provided are fully optimized for each use case, ensuring every step delivers fast, precise results with minimal engineering overhead.

Example of use cases include product categorization (commerce), fraud detection (finance), churn prediction and more.  Discover all of our use cases on our [website](https://neuralk-ai.com).
